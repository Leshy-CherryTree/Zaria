<h1>Editing Zone Libraries</h1>
<h2>What is a library?</h2>
<p>Zone Library is a file that contains paths to Zone files containing game objects.</p>
<p>ApplicationState in Zaria Framework needs to get a library as input.</p>
<p>When creating a <a href="map_edit.html">Game Map</a> you will need to specify a library in your <a href="assets.html">Work Files</a>, so that the map knows where to get placable objects from.</p>
<h2>Editing libraries</h2>
<p>You can edit libraries only in text mode. It is possible to drag files from the file list into the text area.</p>
<p>Libraries in Work Files may contain files from the <a href="assets.html">Assets</a> folder. However libraries in <a href="assets.html">Assets</a> cannot contain files from <a href="assets.html">Work Files</a>.</p>
<p>It is valid to put paths to other libraries in a library. Be wary of circular references though.</p>
