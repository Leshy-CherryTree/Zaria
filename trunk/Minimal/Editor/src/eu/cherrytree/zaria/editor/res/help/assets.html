<h1>Assets and Work Files</h1>

<p>Assets are mainly stored in two directories: Assets and Work Files. There is a clear distinction what kind of file should be where.</p>
<p>When editing a Zone file in the Assets directory a different set of Object Definitions will available compared to a Zone file from the Work Files directory.</p>

<h2>Assets directory</h2>

<p>Assets directory should contain files that are to be used directly by the game and don't need conversion:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Textures</li>
    <li>Audio files</li>
    <li>Models in .j3o format</li>
    <li>Zone files that are used directly by the game (most of them).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is also the directory used for storing assets by the jMonkey Engine SDK.</p>

<h2>Work Files directory</h2>
<p>Work Files should contain files that need to processed before they can be used by the game:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Meshes in .obj and .blend formats</li>
    <li>Maps</li>
    <li>Zone file containing definitions used for map creation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conversion</h2>
<p>Right now files that need conversion are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Meshes in .obj and .blend formats</li>
    <li>Maps</li>
</ul>

<p>To convert meshes double click on it in the file view. A converted version will be created in the Assets directory using the same relative path.</p>
<p>Meshes after conversion are stripped of their materials. To be used properly a mesh needs to be part of a <b>GeometryDefinition</b>.</p>
<p>Maps used unconverted meshes through <b>MapGeometryDefinitions</b>. If a mesh is only to be part of the map geometry it doesn't need to be converted.</p>
<p>In the file view Meshes are are shown using <img src="../icons/zone/mesh_exported.png" alt=""> icon, if they have been already converted and <img src="../icons/zone/mesh_notexported.png" alt=""> if not.
If the file format is no supported <img src="../icons/zone/mesh_invalid.png" alt=""> wil be used.</p>
