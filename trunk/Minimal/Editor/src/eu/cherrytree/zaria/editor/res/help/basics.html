<h1>Basics</h1>

<h2>Zone files</h2>

<p>All game data, except for data inherently binary in nature, such as audio, images and meshes, is stored in ZONE format.
ZONE is a text format that is derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.</p>
<p>All Zone files can be edited in text mode, and most of them also in graph mode.<br></p>
<p>More on editing Zone Files can be found <a href="zone_edit.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>To organize data Zone Libraries are used. A library is a file holding paths to Zone files.</p>
<p>A library is needed to <a href="map_edit.html">edit maps</a> and to run a game based on the Zaria Framework.</p>
<p>More on editing Zone Libraries can be found <a href="library_edit.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Asset directories</h2>

<p>Game assets are located in 3 directories</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assets - Assets that do not need conversion are to be put there. This directory is later packed into a .jar file and used as a source of assets for the running game.</li>
    <li>Work Files - Assets that need conversion are to be put here. After conversion their counterparts are automatically put in the Assets directory.</li>
    <li>Scripts - Only for scripts. This directory is packaged into a single jar for use by the game.</li>
</ul>
