<h1>Editing Zone Files</h1>

<h2>ObjectDefinition IDs</h2>
<p>Every Object Definition has to have an ID. ID is a String which will be used to retrieve the reference the definition.
It has to be unique per library. Meaning that in a single library only one definition can have a specific name.</p>
<p>Valid characters that can be used in IDs are alphanumerical characters and the underscore.</p>

<h2>Graph mode</h2>
<p>Every ObjectDefinition is represented as a single node. Links to other definitions in that file are shown
visually. It is possible to link to definitions in other files. However that can be done only through the property view.</p>
<p>Properties of the definition that are not links are editable in the property view. Just select a node and its properties will visible on the right,
under the Palette.</p>

<p>Changing an ID of a definition will propagate to all other definitions that link to it in the same file. However all external links will have to be modified
manually.</p>

<h2>Text mode</h2>
<p>In some cases it is useful to edit files in text mode, as it provides more information on the correctness and allows for quicker search/replace operations.</p>

<h2>Palette</h2>
<p>On the right of the editing view you will see the palette, which lists all available Object Definitions. Dragging any of them into the
editing area will put it in the Zone file.</p>
