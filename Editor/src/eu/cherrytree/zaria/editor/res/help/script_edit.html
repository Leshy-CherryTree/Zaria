<h1>Editing Scripts</h1>

<p>Scripting in Zaria is done using JavaScript syntax with small additions. To learn more about JavaScript in general visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript section on MDN</a>.</p>

<h2>Imports</h2>
<p>The most significant difference between normal JavaScript and ZoneScript is the addition of <b>imports</b>.</p>
<p>The syntax is the same as imports in Java:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>import</b> path.to.file;</p>
<p>The path takes the Scripts directory as root. The .zonescript extension is not part of the import.</p>
<p>Imports work similarly to imports in Objective-C. All of the source file is put in place of the import command. However the preprocessor makes sure, that nothing is duplicated and no cycles exist.
That means that you can use all variables and functions defined from the included file.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that every script has its own context, so changing a value of a variable from the imported file will not impact any other script, than the one which is importing.</p>
<p>You can drag script files from the file view on the right into the editing area. Proper syntax for importing the file will be generated automatically.</p>

<h2>Function list</h2>
<p>On the right you will have a list of functions that are available to the script. You can drag any of them from the list into the editing area.</p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>
<p>For the scripts to be usable in game they have to be packaged. To do that press <img src="../icons/big/application-x-jar.png" alt="">. That will generate a scripts.jar file at the location specified in config.xml.</p>
